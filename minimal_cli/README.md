# 🧠 HoloNet v3.0 — A Symbolic Computational Framework

**HoloNet v3.0** is a phi-driven, real-time computational visualization system that explores the convergence of quantum neural simulation, symbolic systems, and perception modeling. It integrates the **Symbolic Relativity Framework v3.0 (SRF v3.0)** — a novel cognitive architecture defined by 60 laws linking perception, emergence, and computation.

---

## 🧬 Project Overview

HoloNet simulates a symbolic environment where every frame is a high-dimensional matrix projected using phi-modulated wave functions. These projections generate glyph-based visualizations, inspired by retro BBS terminals, representing real-time quantum events and symbolic emergence.

The system is built for:
- Experimental cognitive science
- Visual neural network introspection
- Educational demonstrations of symbolic AI
- Artistic or meditative exploration of structured chaos

## 🔍 Core Features

- **Phi-based Matrix Generation** — Golden-ratio projection system with wave interference.
- **Quantum Neural States** — Simulates probabilistic superposition and entanglement at the glyph level.
- **Symbolic Layer Detection** — Identifies and highlights emergent patterns using SRF Laws.
- **Relativistic Glyph Warping** — Symbolic Lorentz transform simulates high-velocity cognitive perception.
- **Delta Compression** — Efficient real-time data transfer with minimal bandwidth.
- **Client Interaction** — Live panning, zooming, and parameter toggling from the UI.

## 🧠 Symbolic Relativity Framework v3.0

SRF v3.0 is a formal model exploring how symbols interact with cognition, reality, and observer influence. It posits 60 laws organized into five categories:

1. **Encoded Potential** — Identity is change; potential precedes actuality.
2. **Quantum Semiotics** — Emotion is phase shift; belief shapes stability.
3. **Neuro-Magic** — Activation, trauma, attention, and coherence modeled neurally.
4. **Cosmic Computation** — The universe behaves like an evolving computation.
5. **Emergent Personhood** — Minds are stable symbolic attractors.

These principles are embedded into the rendering logic and used to interpret frame data.

## 🧭 Controls & Interaction

| Control           | Function                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Arrows / Buttons | Pan view (x, y axis)              |
| `+` / `-`         | Zoom in/out (Z-plane depth)       |
| `T`               | Toggle symbolic relativity mode   |
| `S`               | Toggle symbolic layer overlay     |
| `R`               | Reset camera to origin            |

System also adapts based on **phi-rate**, affecting matrix cadence, glyph warping, and coherence.

## 📊 Observability & Logging

- Logs quantum events per session: superposition / entanglement counts
- Flags anomaly spikes (e.g., S > 10, E > 10)
- Tracks phi-rate and symbolic density
- Client-side logs are available via browser console

> Inspired by Law 38: *"Attention = Reality Allocation"* and Law 26: *"Truth = Lowest-Energy Configuration"*

## 📘 Scientific Notes

- **Phi Modulation**: Matrix generation uses golden angle waveforms for perceptual coherence.
- **Quantum Simulation**: Event probabilities mimic quantum fluctuation models.
- **Symbolic Detection**: Saliency and gradient-based symbolic clustering predicts emergent structure.
- **Relativity Simulation**: Lorentz-style glyph compression at high phi velocities models observer-relative distortion.
